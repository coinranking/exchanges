## Development

### Getting started

npm install
```

```shell
node lib/cli.js list
```

#### Get the tickers of a specific exchange

```shell
node lib/cli.js tickers [name of the exchange]
```

##### Flags

| Name      | Flag                    | Description
| ----------| ------------------------| ---
| Record    | `-R`, `--record`        | Record the requests, and save them as fixtures.

### Documentation

See the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) for more information.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct.

### Adding an exchange

1. Add a new driver (see the [examples](#examples))
2. Add the driver alphabetically to drivers/index.js
3. Add a new fixture (use the record option of the CLI 'tickers' command)

Single API calls are highly preferred.
When adding an exchange be aware of the base and quote.
A driver should at least support `base`, `quote`, `close` and `baseVolume` or `quoteVolume`. And optionally `open`, `high`, `low`, `ask`, `bid`, `baseName`, `baseReference`, `quoteName` and `quoteReference`.

### Examples
- [Driver basis:](examples/basicdriver.js) Shows the basic setup of a driver, which can be used as the starting point
for new ones.
- [Driver with API key:](examples/apikeydriver.js) Shows how to set up a driver that uses an API which requires a key.
