Single API calls are highly preferred.
When adding an exchange be aware of the base and quote.
A driver should at least support `base`, `quote`, `close` and `baseVolume` or `quoteVolume`. And optionally `open`, `high`, `low`, `ask`, `bid`, `baseName`, `baseReference`, `quoteName` and `quoteReference`.
